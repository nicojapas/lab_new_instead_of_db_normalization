A company maintains an EMPLOYEE table with information for each of their employees. Write a query to produce a list containing two columns.  The first column should include the name of an employee who earns less than some other employee.  The second column should contain the name of a higher earning employee.  All combinations of lesser and greater earning employees should be included.  Sort ascending, first by the lower earning employee's ID, then by the higher earning employee's SALARY.
